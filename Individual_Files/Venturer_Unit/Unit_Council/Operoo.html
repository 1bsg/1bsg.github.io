        <h1>How to use Operoo (Unit Council guide)</h1>
        <p>To create a digital E1 form on Operoo, first ensure you have a staff account. This is usually only for the Unit Council. If you're planning a night and not on the Unit Council, this responsibility falls on the person Unit Council or Leader, so talk to them.</p>
        <p>Make sure the event organiser has filled out the Terrain Programming event for the activity fully and accurately (see the <a href="Terrain.md">Terrain page</a> if you're not sure) so you can create the eForm to match.</p>
        <p>The below guide will walk you through the steps to create an eForm.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Setup</h2>
            <h3>1. Open a template</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Log into Operoo</li>
                <li>Click "eForms" > "My eForms"</li>
                <li>Click "Add eForm" > "Add Parent Form"</li>
                <li>Click "Use one of your eForm templates"</li>
                <li>Select either the in-hall or out-of-hall template, depending on the event.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Fill out the template</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Update the title to be "YYYY-MM-DD Location - Event" (obviously filling out the information as required)</li>
                <li>You can leave the "@Profile_Name is invited to the following activity organised by @Organization_Name." bit - anything with an @ sign will be handled by Operoo.</li>
                <li>Fill out the title, location, start and finish times and locations. For the location(s), also provide a precise <a href="https://www.what3words.com/">what3words</a> address.</li>
                <li>If there's no cost, delete that table. Otherwise, replace "&lt;$&gt;" with the amount owed.</li>
                <li>"Closing date for this activity" means the last date the Operoo can be responded to</li>
                <li>"Brief activity overview" is where you put a short description</li>
                <li>"Method of transport to and from the activity" is self-explanatory. If people are just getting themselves there (such as for a regular Unit night), just put "Own".</li>
                <li>Under Contact Details:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Coordinator will be Stephen Doggett or whichever adult leader is in charge.</li>
                        <li>The Emergency Contact will usually be Mark Bartter.</li>
                        <li>You can get the phone numbers from the bottom of the <a href="https://groups.operoo.com/buckets/413454/show_profiles">main info page</a>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Under Additional Notes, you can put the full details of the event. Remember, this is what gets sent to parents, so be clear and comprehensive.</li>
                <li>Update the adult supervision / gender supervision table. Usually all three rows are "Yes".</li>
                <li>Leave everything else below the same, with the exception of the "I consent to the participant being involved in the following Adventurous Activities" multiple-choice question
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ensure you remove any irrelevant consent options (i.e. click the delete button next to "Vertical" if you're going on a boating trip)</li>
                        <li>Ensure you make clear the details of the Adventurous Activities that parents are consenting to.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Scroll to the bottom and click Save.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Member Selection</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Click "Add/Remove Members"</li>
                <li>Click the green tick to the left of "1st Balmain Scout Group" to deselect it</li>
                <li>Click the green tick to the left of "1st Balmain Venturer Unit" to select it again</li>
                <li>Click "Add All" to the right of the title in the middle column</li>
                <li>Note: some linking members or other participants may not be listed in the right column. In that case, select the entire Group again and use the search bar to find and add them.</li>
                <li>Click "Save".
                    <ul>
                        <li>There might be a confirmation box, just click "Confirm"</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Settings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Leave most of this page alone, but do edit the following.</li>
                <li>The Event Start Date and the Event End Date</li>
                <li>The date that responses can be accepted up until. All these dates should reflect those mentioned when filling out the template.</li>
                <li>Change the "Frequency of Reminder Emails" to something appropriate. If the event is in a week, try two or three days. Less, maybe do one day, or more, maybe do five to seven days. It just has to be reasonable.</li>
                <li>Tick "Venturer Scouts"</li>
                <li>Tick "Yes" under "Requires up-to-date Care Profile?"</li>
                <li>Under "Send email notification [...]" add the email address(es) of the Lead(ers) of the event</li>
                <li>Change the "Automatically archive this eForm after" date to be roughly a week after the end of the activity. This date can be arbitrary, but ensure it's set.</li>
                <li>Click "Save and Next"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Triggers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Unless you 100% know what you're doing, just click "Next"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>6. Preview</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If you want to proofread and preview the eForm, enter your email address to receive a draft copy as the parents would receive the form.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>7. Permissions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>On the left, click "Assign/Delegate Staff"</li>
                <li>Search for and add Stephen Doggett, Janice Oliver, Theodore Murphy and Sophie Poulos (so the Unit leadership can access)</li>
                <li>Click "Delegate"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>8. Enable</h3>
            <p>When you're 100% happy with your eForm, just use Jandi to let Mark know (tag him, @Heston) and he'll check and enable the form. He's the only one who can enable and edit enabled forms, so if there's an issue, just let him know.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Other Actions</h2>
            <h3>Edit the form before enabling</h3>
            <p>Once the form is enabled, you'll have to get into contact with Mark to edit it. Before that, though, you can click on "eForms" > "My eForms" then the "Edit" button on the appropriate form.</p>

            <h3>Send reminders/messages</h3>
            <p>Operoo lets you email, SMS or app-notify parents before, during, or after an activity. You can send updates, provide additional information, or notify of a late return.</p>
            <p>Make sure you're either in the Edit view (see above) or the standard view where you can see all members and their responses to the eForm. Then the options for "Send SMS", "Send Email", and so on are available.</p>

            <h4>Email</h4>
            <p>This option lets you send an email to all the parents who have accepted the eForm. Keep in mind that emails are not always the best method of communicating information quickly, but if it's non-urgent and before the event, it's a good choice.</p>

            <h4>SMS</h4>
            <p>This option lets you send a text message straight to the phone numbers of all the parents who have accepted the eForm. It's a great way to get urgent or time-sensitive information out. The message will appear to be from "OPEROO" so make sure you're clear on why they're receiving the message. Keep in mind also that SMS messages sent from Operoo cost 1st Balmain a small amount in credits each time, so don't spam.</p>

            <h4>Push Notification</h4>
            <p>This option lets you send an app notification to all the parents who have accepted the eForm. It's free, and pretty similar to the SMS option, but it only applies to parents who have installed the app. Unfortunately, since many parents don't have the app, it may be an unreliable way of delivering information.</p>

            <h3>View who's accepted the eForm</h3>
            <p>On the Home page, click the "View XX Members" button on the relevant eForm. Then, you can use the "All Response Statuses" dropdown to filter for only those who have accepted, declined, or not yet responded.</p>
            <p>The Home page also gives you a preview of the number of accept/decline responses next to a tick or cross (respectively) badged on the eForm tile.</p>
